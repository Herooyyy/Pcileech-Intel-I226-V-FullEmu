# Pcileech-Intel-I226-V-FullEmu

This project realizes the use of phantom data by the intel i225-v/i226-v network card, and disguises it as a "false" Ethernet connection state. Through TCP sending and receiving data packets, the network card is in an "active state" to pass the activity detection of VGK/FAC/EAC. At present, it still passes the test on all anti-cheating.

此项目实现了intel i225-v/i226-v网卡使用幻数据，并伪装成“虚假的”以太网连接状态，通过TCP收发数据包以使网卡处于“活跃状态”以此通过VGK/FAC/EAC的活跃度检测。目前，其依旧在所有的反作弊上通过检测。
